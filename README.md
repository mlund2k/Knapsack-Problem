# Knapsack-Problem


My personal attempt at optimizing the Knapsack Problem using C++ code and dynamic programming algorithms.

The algorithm works by first taking in a list of items by both value and weight, a total weight of knapsack, then constructs a dynamic programming matrix iteratively to find the best possible solution.

[View Code](https://github.com/mlund2k/Knapsack-Problem/blob/main/knapsack.cpp)


"Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible."
